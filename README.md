## 3. Integrated Data Sources

Fit-Bot integrates real-world APIs to provide dynamic responses:
- **Spoonacular API**: Fetches healthy meal recipes based on user preferences.
- **ExerciseDB API**: Retrieves targeted workout exercises, filtered for home or gym workouts.

These APIs ensure that the chatbot provides **up-to-date meal plans and workouts** instead of relying on static, predefined data.

## 4. Challenges and Solutions

### **Handling API Errors and Failures**
 **Problem:** API requests may fail due to network issues or quota limits.  
 **Solution:** If an API fails, Fit-Bot provides **fallback responses**:
- If Spoonacular API is unavailable, the bot suggests **pre-stored healthy meal options**.
- If ExerciseDB API fails, the bot suggests **common bodyweight exercises**.

### **Managing User Preferences Efficiently**
 **Problem:** Users provide diverse dietary preferences, sometimes conflicting.  
 **Solution:** Fit-Bot **maps different dietary inputs** and ensures users always receive meal suggestions.

### **Ensuring Meaningful Conversations**
 **Problem:** Users might enter unexpected inputs.  
 **Solution:** The bot uses **fallback policies** to clarify user intent and guide the conversation.
